# mininet - Linear Topology (with Performance Settings)

In addition to basic behavioral networking, Mininet provides performance limiting and isolation
features, through the CPULimitedHost and TCLink classes.
There are multiple ways that these classes may be used, but one simple way is to specify them
as the default host and link classes/constructors to Mininet(), and then to specify the
appropriate parameters in the topology.
