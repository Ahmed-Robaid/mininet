<j>Data center networks typically have a tree-like topology. End-hosts connect to top-of-rack switches, which form the leaves (edges) of the tree; one or more core switches form the root; and one or more layers of aggregation switches form the middle of the tree. In a basic tree topology, each switch (except the core switch) has a single parent switch. Additional switches
and links may be added to construct more complex tree topologies (e.g., fat tree) in an effort to improve fault tolerance or increase inter-rack bandwidth. In this assignment, your task is to create a simple tree topology. You will assume each level i.e., core, aggregation, edge and host to be composed of a single layer of switches/hosts with a configurable fanout value (k). For example, a simple tree network having a single layer per each level and a fanout of 2 looks like:</j>

##### CustomTopo.py
The skeleton class takes following arguments as input:
- <b>linkopts1</b>: for specifying performance parameters for the links between core and aggregation switches.
- <b>linkopts2</b>: for specifying performance parameters for the links between aggregation and edge switches.
- <b>linkopts3</b>: for specifying performance parameters for the links between edge switches and host.
- <b>Fanout</b>: to specify fanout value i.e., number of childs per node.

Your logic should support setting at least bw and delay parameters for each link.
