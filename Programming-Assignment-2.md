##### Programming Assignment 2: Using Mininet and Mininet Python API: Instructions

In this exercise, you will be learning how to build custom topologies using Mininet Python API and how certain parameters like bandwidth, delay, loss and queue size can be set individually
for different links in the topology. Youâ€™ll also learn how to do performance testing of these custom topologies using ping and iperf.
After the overview, you will be asked to create and submit your own custom topology based on the most common 3-tier Datacenter architecture i.e., core, aggregation and edge. More details
on creating and submitting the code will be provided later on in the instructions. So, make sure that you follow each step carefully.

Overview

The network you'll use in this exercise includes hosts and switches connected in a linear
topology, as shown in the figure below.
